## 1. Yearly Performance Evaluation Plan  

### Purpose  
Yearly evaluations provide a structured opportunity to assess research progress, professional development, and contributions to the lab. The process ensures alignment with lab goals and external funding obligations.  

### Timing  
- Formal evaluations will occur **once per calendar year** (typically late spring or early summer).  
- Informal check-ins may be scheduled as needed.  

### Criteria  
Evaluations will consider:  
1. **Research Progress**:  
   - Completion of assigned milestones, including project deliverables tied to external grants.  
   - Quality and reproducibility of data, code, and analyses.  
2. **Publications & Dissemination**:  
   - For graduate students and postdocs: expectation of **one peer-reviewed publication per year** (authorship level dependent on contribution).  
   - Conference abstracts, posters, or talks presented.  
3. **Engagement & Professionalism**:  
   - Attendance at weekly lab meetings.  
   - Contributions to collaborative projects and code repositories.  
   - Adherence to lab and university policies.  
4. **Development**:  
   - Acquisition of new skills (technical, computational, communication).  
   - Mentoring of junior members (when applicable).  

### Process  
- Each member will submit a **self-assessment** covering the above criteria.  
- The PI will provide a **written evaluation**, with constructive feedback and clear goals for the following year.  
- A one-on-one meeting will be held to review the evaluation and agree on next steps.

## 2. Mentoring Plan  

### Philosophy  
The ZeD Lab is committed to providing graduate students and postdocs with mentorship that prepares them for independent careers in academia, industry, or government. Mentorship will be tailored to individual needs, but guided by the following principles.  

### PI Commitments  
- **Intellectual Guidance**: Assist in defining research questions, structuring analyses, and interpreting findings.  
- **Career Development**: Provide support for fellowship, grant, and job applications; write recommendation letters; facilitate networking opportunities.  
- **Skill Building**: Encourage training in advanced computational methods, data science practices, and scientific communication.  
- **Transparency**: Set clear expectations on authorship, deadlines, and deliverables.  
- **Accessibility**: Maintain an open-door policy for research and career discussions.  

### Graduate Student & Postdoc Commitments  
- **Initiative**: Take primary responsibility for driving projects forward, seeking feedback, and managing timelines.  
- **Communication**: Provide regular updates to the PI and collaborators; raise issues early if progress is blocked.  
- **Professional Growth**: Pursue training opportunities and skill development beyond immediate project needs.  
- **Mentorship of Others**: Assist in guiding undergraduates or junior lab members when appropriate.  

### Annual Mentoring Review  
- During the yearly performance evaluation, mentoring effectiveness will also be assessed.  
- Students and postdocs will provide feedback on whether their mentoring needs are being met.  
- Adjustments to mentoring style, frequency of meetings, or project alignment will be made based on this feedback.

## 3. Integration with Lab Policies  
- This plan supplements the [ZeD Lab Policies](ZeD_policies.md).  
- Funding availability and **University of Kentucky policies** always take precedence.  
- The plan will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.
