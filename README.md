## Overview
This repo consolidates all group‑level materials into one place. It now serves as the **general policy hub** for the ZeD Lab:

- Policies that govern lab operations and expectations
- Onboarding steps for accepted members (post‑screening)
- Skill tests used during candidate evaluation

If you are **already accepted**, please start with the **Onboarding** document. If you are a **candidate**, complete the **Skill Tests** assigned to your level.
