# ZeD Lab Expectations and Policies (v1.1)  
**University of Kentucky**

This document outlines expectations and laboratory policies for all members of the ZeD Lab. By joining the group, you agree to abide by the following guidelines, which ensure fairness, accountability, and the success of our collective research mission.

## 0. Funding Commitments Disclaimer  
All commitments related to stipends, travel, conference support, and research expenses are **subject to the availability of funds**. While the lab will make every effort to secure and maintain external funding, continuation of financial support depends on successful renewal of grants, contracts, or other sources.

## 1. Expectations  

### PI Expectations of Members  
- Contribute substantively to research projects, with the expectation of **at least one peer-reviewed publication per year** (authorship level depending on contribution).  
- Deliver on milestones and deadlines associated with **externally funded programs**; timely delivery of results is critical to maintaining support.  
- Actively participate in group meetings, collaborative projects, and professional development activities.  
- Uphold the highest standards of scientific integrity, professionalism, and ethical conduct.  

### Members’ Expectations of the PI  
- Provide **intellectual support** in shaping research questions, guiding analysis, and interpreting results.  
- Offer **mentoring and career support**, including advice on publications, presentations, funding opportunities, and career paths.  
- Advocate for members in professional settings and provide opportunities for networking and collaboration.  
- Ensure access to necessary resources (HPC clusters, datasets, code repositories) and maintain a safe, respectful, and inclusive research environment.

## 2. Work Hours  
- **Graduate Students and Postdocs**: Expected to maintain ~40 hours/week, with flexibility to accommodate academic obligations.  
- **Undergraduate and Paid Student Researchers**: Hours must comply with University of Kentucky employment policies.

## 4. Group Meetings

- **Preparation**: Members must present updates, progress, and challenges.  

---

## 5. Deadlines & Deliverables  
- **Externally Funded Programs**: Deadlines tied to grants must be met; delays jeopardize lab funding and reputation.  
- **Internal Deadlines**: Lab project milestones are binding unless negotiated ahead of time.  

---

## 6. Code Repositories (Mandatory Policy)  
- **Central Repository**: All code written as part of ZeD Lab projects must be submitted to the official **ZeD Lab GitHub repositories**.  
- **Ownership**: In accordance with University of Kentucky intellectual property policies, all code generated in the lab is considered university-owned IP.  
- **No Private Stash**: Local or private copies of research code are not acceptable as final records. All active development must be pushed to the shared repository.  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Commit frequently with meaningful messages.  
  - Document code adequately so others can reuse and build upon it.  
  - Use branches and pull requests where appropriate.  
- **Accountability**: Failure to submit code to the repository will be treated as a violation of lab policy and could affect authorship, evaluations, and continued participation.  

---

## 7. Authorship Policy  
- **General Principle**: Authorship is earned by **substantial intellectual contribution**, not mere participation.  
- **Criteria (ICMJE standards)**:  
  1. Significant contributions to conception/design, data acquisition, analysis, or interpretation.  
  2. Drafting the manuscript or revising it critically.  
  3. Final approval of the version to be published.  
  4. Accountability for all aspects of the work.  
- **Order of Authors**: Determined by consensus; PI resolves disputes. First author = primary lead; last author = PI. Co-first authorship is possible if justified.  
- **Acknowledgments**: Limited contributions (e.g., routine support) should be acknowledged, not granted authorship.  
- **Transparency**: Authorship and order must be agreed upon before submission.

## 9. Paid Internships & Student Researchers  
- Paid positions are capped by UK employment policies.  
- Paid hours must be logged and limited to research activities.

## 10. Intellectual Property (IP) Ownership  
- **University Policy**: All inventions, software, and IP created using UK resources fall under university IP policy.  
- **Lab Outputs**: Code, models, datasets, and methods developed in the lab are considered collective research outputs.  
- **Open-Source Licensing**: Any public release of code requires PI approval and compliance with UK policies.  
- **Collaborations**: Joint IP with external partners will follow the signed agreements.  
- **Student Work**: Theses, dissertations, and other academic work leading to IP are considered part of the lab’s collective research.
